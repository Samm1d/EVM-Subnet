# EVM-Subnet
--- 
## Overview

This project involves setting up and deploying a custom EVM subnet using Avalanche CLI, integrating it with Metamask, and deploying smart contracts using Remix. Below are the step-by-step instructions to achieve this, along with the tools required.

## Tools Used

- **Unix Computer** (MacOS or Linux)
- **Solidity**
- **Remix IDE**
- **MetaMask**
- **Web Browser**

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Deploy Your EVM Subnet Using Avalanche CLI

- **Install Avalanche CLI**:
  Make sure you have the Avalanche CLI installed. You can install it using the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g avajava
  ```

- **Create and Configure Subnet**:
  Use the Avalanche CLI to create your subnet. Follow the official documentation or use the command below to create a new subnet:
  ```bash
  avalanche subnet create --name <subnet_name> --description "<description>"
  ```

### 2. Add Your Subnet to Metamask

- **Open Metamask**:
  Open your Metamask extension in your web browser.

- **Add Network**:
  Go to `Settings` > `Networks` > `Add Network`. Fill in the network details provided by Avalanche. These details typically include the Network Name, RPC URL, Chain ID, and Symbol. 

### 3. Make Sure It is Your Selected Network in Metamask

- **Switch Network**:
  Ensure that the new subnet is selected in Metamask. You can switch networks by clicking on the network dropdown at the top of the Metamask extension.

### 4. Connect Remix to Your Metamask

- **Open Remix IDE**:
  Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your web browser.

- **Connect to Metamask**:
  In Remix, go to the `Deploy & Run Transactions` plugin. Select `Injected Provider` from the environment dropdown. This will connect Remix to your Metamask account.

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contracts

- **Write Your Smart Contracts**:
  Write your Solidity smart contracts in the `Solidity Compiler` plugin. Make sure to compile your contracts by selecting the appropriate version of the compiler.

- **Deploy Contracts**:
  In the `Deploy & Run Transactions` plugin, select your subnet network from the dropdown. Deploy your smart contracts by selecting them and clicking the `Deploy` button.

### 6. Test Your Application

- **Interact with Contracts**:
  Use Remix to interact with your deployed contracts. You can deploy tokens, create pools, and test various functionalities by calling functions on your deployed contracts.

## Conclusion

You have now set up a custom EVM subnet on Avalanche, integrated it with Metamask, and deployed your smart contracts using Remix. You can further extend your project by adding more functionalities and testing them thoroughly.
